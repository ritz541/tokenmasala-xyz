# Changelog

All notable changes to tokenmaxxing are documented here. Versions are anchored to the
`cli-v*` release tags because the CLI is the project's current released artifact.

## Unreleased

## 0.4.18-alpha.0 - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added native, config-owned service runners for scheduled syncs so launchd, systemd, and Windows Task Scheduler no longer depend on ambient Node, npm, Bun, or vite-plus paths.
- Added generated platform runner package publishing with npm prerelease dist-tags.

### Changed

- Changed scheduled service auto-update to fetch verified runner packages from the npm registry and atomically advance the service runner pointer.

### Fixed

- Hardened service install, repair, and runner update locking so concurrent repairs and updates cannot overlap.
- Prevented deferred launchd repairs from reloading the active launchd job from inside itself.

## 0.4.17 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Made scheduled Linux service repairs use `systemd-run --user` so reload-required repairs survive systemd oneshot cleanup.

## 0.4.16 - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- Removed the service auto-update opt-out so scheduled services always attempt CLI updates when package-manager metadata is available.
- Bumped the service template so installed schedulers refresh away from legacy auto-update metadata.

### Fixed

- Made service install and repair keep working when the package manager cannot be detected, while reporting the missing manager through auto-update telemetry.

## 0.4.15 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added structured auto-update telemetry for scheduled service check-ins so fleet status can show update-blocked devices with concrete reasons.

### Changed

- Made scheduled service auto-update verify the installed CLI version after package-manager updates before reporting success.

## 0.4.14 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added automatic service repair telemetry for scheduled sync check-ins and internal fleet details.

### Changed

- Made scheduled service runs retry deferred scheduler repair when the scheduler is inactive, the service template is stale, auto-update changes the CLI, or the service run fails.

### Fixed

- Fixed inline command snippets so CLI flags render with visible spacing instead of font ligatures.

## 0.4.13 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added `tokenmaxxing service repair` to refresh service files and re-register native schedulers.
