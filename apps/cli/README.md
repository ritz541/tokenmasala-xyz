# @851-labs/tokenmaxxing

CLI for [tokenmaxxing](https://tokenmaxxing.sh) — the social leaderboard
for LLM token usage. Parses your local agent usage (Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI) via
[ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) and pushes daily aggregates
to your public profile.

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g @851-labs/tokenmaxxing
tokenmaxxing login              # sign in in the browser, approves this device
tokenmaxxing sync               # parse local usage and push it
tokenmaxxing service install    # optional: sync automatically every 5 minutes
tokenmaxxing upgrade            # upgrade the global CLI and refresh the service
```

You can also install globally with `bun install -g`, `pnpm add -g`, or
`yarn global add`.

The background service uses the global `tokenmaxxing` binary and syncs every
5 minutes. By default it auto-updates through
the package manager that installed the global binary (bun, npm, pnpm, or yarn);
pass `--no-auto-update` to `service install` if you want to upgrade manually.
Use `tokenmaxxing service status` for the last run and `tokenmaxxing service
doctor` to inspect scheduler files, auth, auto-update, locks, and recent logs.

Run `sync` as often as you like, from as many machines as you like —
profiles aggregate across devices. Useful flags: `--dry-run`,
`--since YYYY-MM-DD`, `--sources claude,codex`, `--json`.

### What gets uploaded (privacy)

Daily aggregates only: date, model name, agent name, token counts, and the
API-equivalent cost — never prompts, file paths, project names, or session
content. Revoke access anytime with `tokenmaxxing logout` or from
[settings](https://tokenmaxxing.sh/settings).
