> The public leaderboard for LLM coding-agent token usage. TokenMasala syncs your local usage from supported coding agents, turns it into daily token and spend totals, and lets you compare with other users on a public leaderboard.

## How to join

Install the CLI, then run the bootstrap command. Bootstrap signs you in, syncs your usage, and can set up automatic syncing.

\`\`\`
npm install -g @851-labs/tokenmaxxing@latest
tokenmaxxing bootstrap
\`\`\`

## Supported agents

Usage is parsed locally via [ccusage](https://ccusage.com/). Only daily aggregates (date, model name, agent source, token counts, and API-equivalent cost) are uploaded — prompts, file paths, project names, and session content are never uploaded.
