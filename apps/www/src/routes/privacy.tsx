        <Section title="What we collect">
          tokenmaxxing collects daily usage aggregates only: the date, model name, agent source,
          token counts, and an API-equivalent cost estimate. When you sign in we also store your
          OAuth profile basics (username and avatar) and the hostnames of the devices you sync from.
        </Section>

        <Section title="What we never collect">
          Prompts, file paths, project names, and session content are never uploaded. We only ever
          receive the aggregated counts described above — never the contents of your conversations
          or your code.
        </Section>

        <Section title="How data is sourced">
          The CLI uses <ExternalLink href={CCUSAGE_URL}>ccusage</ExternalLink> to parse usage
          locally from supported coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and
          Copilot CLI). It only reads usage data that still exists on your computer; if an agent has
          already cleaned up its local logs, that data cannot be recovered or uploaded. You can
          preview exactly what would be sent with <Code>tokenmaxxing sync --dry-run</Code>.
        </Section>

        <Section title="What is public and what is private">
          Profiles and leaderboard totals are public — your username, avatar, and aggregated usage
          are visible to anyone. Device hostnames are private and shown only to you in settings and
          in your own per-device breakdown.
        </Section>

        <Section title="How we use your data">
          We use the data you sync to compute and display leaderboard rankings and your public
          profile, and to show you your own per-device usage breakdown.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Retention and deletion">
          You stay in control of your data. CLI tokens do not expire automatically, but you can
          revoke them at any time with <Code>tokenmaxxing logout</Code> or from your settings page.
          You can also remove device data from settings.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Third parties">
          We rely on your chosen OAuth provider to sign you in, and on the public GitHub API to show
          the repository&apos;s star count. We don&apos;t sell your data or share it with
          advertisers.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Changes and contact">
          We may update this policy over time. Questions about your data can be raised on{" "}
          <ExternalLink href={GITHUB_URL}>GitHub</ExternalLink> or in our{" "}
          <ExternalLink href={DISCORD_URL}>Discord</ExternalLink>.
